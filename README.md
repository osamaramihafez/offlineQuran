### Offline Quran Journey

The objective of this project is to allow followers of Quran Journey classes to listen to the audio of the lessons. It should allow them to take notes on timestamps that they have bookmarked as well as connect their timestamps to the notes for reference.


Possible Expansion ideas:

- Moving the app frontend to flutter would allow us to create one codebase for all operating systems. We could then focus on allowing all of the content to be downloaded and played offline.
